This book opens up very strong, and the characters and their mysterious origins and powers are quite interesting. The central plot is about 12 adopted siblings with special unique powers, working together to go back to their home, the mysterious &amp;lsquo;Library&amp;rsquo;. Along the way you learn about their powers and how they came to be, as well as their adopted &amp;lsquo;Father&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Childhood&amp;rsquo;s End by Arthur C. Clarke My rating: 4 of 5 stars
This is a book about human civilization&amp;rsquo;s evolution. The Overlords fix all our problems and unite humanity, but we slowly regress over the decades from finding meaning in life to having no purpose at all, life becomes all leisure. The universe of course, has different plans for humanity and provides us with an ultimate purpose. This story is very multi-layered and hits upon so many philosophical and religious questions.</description>
