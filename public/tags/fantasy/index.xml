      <description>The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins My rating: 3 of 5 stars
This book opens up very strong, and the characters and their mysterious origins and powers are quite interesting. The central plot is about 12 adopted siblings with special unique powers, working together to go back to their home, the mysterious &amp;lsquo;Library&amp;rsquo;. Along the way you learn about their powers and how they came to be, as well as their adopted &amp;lsquo;Father&amp;rsquo;.</description>
