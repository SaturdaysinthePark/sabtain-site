      <description>David Copperfield by Charles Dickens My rating: 5 of 5 stars
This is one of the few novels that I felt complete at its finish. Yes, parts of it are slow, but if you pay attention, and think deeply about the characters and how everything plays out chapter by chapter&amp;hellip;. you will get entranced in the beautiful Dickensian language and the plots eventually embodying the protagonist, David Copperfield.
The novel is about David Copperfield, and his coming-of-age&amp;hellip; It features everything, from childhood abuse and trauma, schooling, loss, friendship, family, love, marriage, business, villains etc&amp;hellip; Alogn the way, it helped me realize that things CAN be alright, and with time, patience and perseverance, I could overcome many obstacles.</description>

      <description>The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins My rating: 3 of 5 stars
This book opens up very strong, and the characters and their mysterious origins and powers are quite interesting. The central plot is about 12 adopted siblings with special unique powers, working together to go back to their home, the mysterious &amp;lsquo;Library&amp;rsquo;. Along the way you learn about their powers and how they came to be, as well as their adopted &amp;lsquo;Father&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Educated by Tara Westover My rating: 5 of 5 stars
This was a tough book to read because of the frustration at the circumstances Tara was born into and the inability for many around her to provide proper support to her, but at the same time it was hard to put down. There are still - and may always be - families diseased with issues that stem from inflicted personality, poor history, and sheltered environments, and it seeps into the parents&amp;rsquo; children and affects them in so many various harmful ways.</description>

      <description>Childhood&amp;rsquo;s End by Arthur C. Clarke My rating: 4 of 5 stars
This is a book about human civilization&amp;rsquo;s evolution. The Overlords fix all our problems and unite humanity, but we slowly regress over the decades from finding meaning in life to having no purpose at all, life becomes all leisure. The universe of course, has different plans for humanity and provides us with an ultimate purpose. This story is very multi-layered and hits upon so many philosophical and religious questions.</description>
