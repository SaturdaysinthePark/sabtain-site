My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2764223917">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I think Sally Rooney is a good author, I believe in it, and I think an immature version of my brain can connect with her characters, and maybe that's a skill of its own - writing those types of characters must take talent! Normal People is about Collin and Marianne, who are different from each other, an unlikely pair, but eventually, find some mutual romantic interest.<br /><br />It all really falls apart, as humans tend to care a lot about what other humans think about their interpersonal matters, and Collin is no exception.. he is extremely self-conscious about his social status in comparison to Marianne. Thus the story turns into a back and forth over time between the two of them and other friends.<br /><br />I don't hate the novel, but hate that in some way its alluded to that this is all 'normal', it doesn't have to be normal.. people make the choice to cave to social pressures and expectations. Maybe that's the point, to show us readers that we can break this normality, actually communicate to each other? Maybe!<br /><br />Some words I wrote down that I just wanted to define and learn:<br /><b>Pantomime</b> Dramatic entertainment of roman origins<br /><b>Derisive</b> Expressing contempt or ridicule<br /><b>Prurient</b>: Encouraging an excessive interest in sexual matters<br /><b>Farcical</b> Relating to farce, especially because of absurd or ridiculous aspects
