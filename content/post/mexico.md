Clarke</a><br/>
My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2652267235">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This is a book about human civilization's evolution. The Overlords fix all our problems and unite humanity, but we slowly regress over the decades from finding meaning in life to having no purpose at all, life becomes all leisure. The universe of course, has different plans for humanity and provides us with an ultimate purpose. This story is very multi-layered and hits upon so many philosophical and religious questions. Sci-Fi readers, this is a must; as well as those of you interested in Utopian societies, philosophical questions, and experimenting with civilization.
