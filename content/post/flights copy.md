My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3008419921">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
<blockquote>"...it's animals taking revenge on people..."</blockquote><br /><br />I loved this much more than <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36885304.Flights" title="Flights by Olga Tokarczuk" rel="nofollow">Flights</a>, this is a much more cohesive story. There's a good mystery that drives the plot, and a lot of focus on our relationship with the environment, animals, and earth. The main character (Janina) is a bit eccentric and very into astrology, but throughout the book you believe her, and you sympathize with her point of view. <br /><br />Janina asks people in the story, and the reader questions such as <i>"What sort of world is this where killing and pain are the norm?"</i>, she's talking about animals; but its beyond that, its the whole ecosystem, its humans, its more. She says, <i>"Attitude towards animals...show the truth about a country"</i> which implies that if a country can not even hold respect for an animal, maybe there are other things it will take for granted as time goes on.<br /><br />There's a lot of funny remarks, observations, etc..:<br /><i>"Are you religious?"</i><br /><i>"Yes...I'm an athiest"</i><br /><br /><i>"...someone who overuses the phrase 'in truth' is sure to be a liar"</i><br /><br /><i>"...it seems to me we're living in a world that we fabricate for ourselves. We decide what's good and what isn't...and then we spend our whole lives struggling with what we have invented for ourselves..." </i><br /><br />This book's mystery and characters are terrific. Its an engrossing read where I really felt like I was in a snow covered remote part of Poland, isolated from society, trying to mind my own business like Janina. I'm glad <i>Flights</i> by Olga didn't discourage me from reading this, highly recommended!<br /><br />Some words I learned:<br /><b>Foehn</b>: A hot southern wind on the northern slopes of the alps.<br /><b>Reconnoiter</b>: Make a military observation of a region<br /><b>Saturnine</b>: (of a person) Slow and gloomy; or dark in color, moody, mysterious<br /><b>Chiaroscuro</b>: Treatment of light and shade in drawing and painting<br /><b>Tenebrism</b>: Dark, gloomy, mysterious; dramatic illumination<br /><b>Taphonomy</b>: Branch of paleontology that deals with fossilization
