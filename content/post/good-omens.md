My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2737984183">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I love Gaiman, and I've read so many of his prior novels, i've never read Pratchett before this, but had only heard great things. I've also never read a novel written by two great authors, and with all the praise and hype, this was easily a must read for myself. However, I wouldn't say this is a book for fans of Gaiman's other novels.<br /><br />This book is humorous and makes fun of a lot of religion and the whole concept of the judgement day. It does get overly complicated, and then you start wondering, what is the point of all this. I thought the characters and comments were funny and witty, but I don't know if that was enough for me to say its a must-read, I would rather go back and read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14497.Neverwhere__London_Below___1_" title="Neverwhere (London Below, #1) by Neil Gaiman" rel="nofollow">Neverwhere</a>.<br /><br />Read this if you enjoyed <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy__Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy___1_" title="The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #1) by Douglas Adams" rel="nofollow">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>
