My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2703677570">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This book is about the study of how our minds are taught from an early age to reason that things are based on causation rather than that purpose give way to phenomenon. An example is that we don't suffer from carrying psychic wounds, we suffer from attaching meaning to past trauma. We take an objective thing, and add a subjective meaning to it.<br /><br />The book dives into acceptance, self-validation, friendships, family etc.... We associate value to so many things, and by attaching value to people, attributes, events etc... we make them more than they are. How can we live and be happy if we live to pursue other people's values?<br /><br />I can break down everything you will learn from this book, but then i'd just be re-writing it. It's such a fascinating read that will leave you thinking about every thought, action, reaction, emotion etc... that you have. You'll want to change your life for the better.<br /><br />The advice in this book, and the format its given in, is very simple and easy to digest. It is up to you to change your life and reflect on your inner and outer self.
