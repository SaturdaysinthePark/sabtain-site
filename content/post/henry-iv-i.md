My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3036968569">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This play's plot is really about two very different rebellions. The first being focused on Hal, aka Prince Henry, and his insubordination towards his father, King Henry IV, and his eventual coming to terms with his responsibility and duties as a Prince. Then there is the Welsh rebellion that King Henry IV is dealing with.<br /><br />Most of the focus is on Hal and his tavern friends as they play pranks, commit robbery, perform plays etc... and are largely influenced by one of Shakespeare's most famous creations, the comedic fat rebellious dishonorable oaf who is named Falstaff.<br /><br />It's quite a bit more fun to read this play than Richard II, there's more action, more plotting, and Falstaff and Hal's surrogate father-son relationship, along with the tavern crowd, is amusing to see unfold. Falstaff is quick to think on his feet, and 'save' himself from embarrassing situations with just the right words, below he pretends that his cowardice was all an act:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />FALSTAFF<br />By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.<br />Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the<br />heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?<br />why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but<br />beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true<br />prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a<br /><b>coward on instinct</b>. I shall think the better of<br />myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant<br />lion, and thou for a true prince.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />There's also the question of honor. King Henry IV is making the comparison of Hotspur, who resembles an honorable soldier, to his son Hal, the rebel. Its a central theme in the play, exploring the role of honor in kings, princes, soldiers, commoners, and war. Below Falstaff reflect on the meaning of honor, clearly it means nothing to him, as it is 'air':<br /><br /><blockquote><br />FALSTAFF<br />Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks<br />me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I<br />come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or<br />an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.<br />Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is<br />honour? a word. <b>What is in that word honour? what<br />is that honour? air.</b><br /></blockquote><br /><br />All in all, this was terrific to read, Shakespeare is far from boring when it comes to telling the History of England in his plays.
