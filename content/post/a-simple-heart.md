My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2704919831">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Admittedly, I read this book because I wanted to prepare myself to read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1462.Julian_Barnes" title="Julian Barnes" rel="nofollow">Julian Barnes</a>'s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2176.Flaubert_s_Parrot" title="Flaubert's Parrot by Julian Barnes" rel="nofollow">Flaubert's Parrot</a>. I also quite enjoyed <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2175.Madame_Bovary" title="Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert" rel="nofollow">Madame Bovary</a>, so was looking forward to something short by Flaubert.<br /><br />The short novel is about a servant named Félicité who really is someone with a simple heart. A simple story about a woman who pours her heart and devotion into everything. Whats quite fascinating is that even in the un-caring, unaffectionate world, Félicité never wavers in her ability to be caring. <br /><br />Sometimes I felt irritated by Félicité, and wonder if you are supposed to, is she just an utter fool, or is she pure good? Or, is it I, who is a fool for being irritated at Félicité?
