# Summary

I sort of segmented everything in this pseudo FAQ, based on real questions I get about books and my reading habits. It seems like a nice way to convey everything, and I hope you enjoy.

A lot of the stats/figures I reference are actually part of a spreadsheet I use to track my reading habits, check it out [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nwb3f6ellfckRrbwsnnP2fp8JWe8oTKoVJ2UXICE_R8/edit?usp=sharing).


### How many books did you read this year (2019)? Past 5 years?
This year, 82, but the amount isn't _that_ important. Past 5 years, 341.

### How do you read so much?
The most important thing I do is set aside an hour a day to read, just about nothing gets in my way of that time. Then there is time waiting on trains, in a train, waiting for a plane, on a plane, etc.. Then there are glorious days where I do nothing but read.

The point is. I don't read fast. I just spend a lot of time reading. I'll elaborate further:

Test yourself later, go to this site: https://howlongtoread.com/books/3032/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerers-Stone

Click on `Test Reading Speed` and then compare with my result below:

```
You read 226 words in 38.2 seconds. Your recorded speed for this passage was 355 words per minute. It will take you 4 hours and 31 minutes to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
```

My speed fluctuates, sometimes its 400 words per minute, sometimes its 350. _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_ would be 3.5 hrs to 4.5 hrs, depends on focus, coffee, whether or not I take notes, and how much notes I take - some books I'm jotting a lot down.


### Why do you read so much?
I picked up reading much more in 2014. Two books encouraged me read much more. First, [The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo) got me turning pages like no other. Second, [Alexander Hamilton's biography](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130.Alexander_Hamilton) by Ron Chernow.

I learned that just about every major leader in our world was obsessed with reading. Since then I've taken notice that people like Barack Obama, Napoleon Bonaparte, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Teddy Roosevelt, etc... are (or were) all voracious readers.

At this point, its an irrefutable fact to myself that I would not see any successes personally or professionally if I was not actively reading like I am now.

### How do you pick your next book?
Its all a feeling and relevancy thing. I try to change up what I'm reading often, so that I'm not stuck in the same genre.

I also value recommendations, so recommend away!

### Do you really read Harry Potter every October?
Yes, you'll see that October book count spike up in the graphs above! That's my tradition. Its fun and I've met other friends who have re-read traditions with Jane Austen, Tolkien, and more... 

### Where and when do you read?
When I first moved to New York, I was reading in the evening, usually at The Bean on 2nd Ave.

Now, I am generally reading before work ~7:30AM to 8:30am (give or take 15 minutes) at a [coffee shop](https://foursquare.com/v/city-of-saints-coffee-roasters/53a7157d498e74f8079c3814) [near my apartment](https://foursquare.com/v/787-coffee/5bb4cdac28374e002bac356a).

When the weather is just right, I'll often be at Washington Square Park with an [iced coffee from](https://foursquare.com/v/stumptown-coffee-roasters/512f8233e4b04458d4385195) [somewhere nearby](https://foursquare.com/v/lena/533c3d8b498e53ce081773f0).

### Do you read on your phone on kindle? audio book?
Primarily, I read in hardcover/paperback books. I never got into audio books, just not my cup of tea.

### Do you take notes while you read?
Initially, I did not. I sort of scribbled in the book I was reading: underlinining, circling, etc...

Two years ago I started to write notes in a journal.

This year I've begun to write reviews (on GoodReads and published on this site)

### Do you mostly read fiction or non-fiction?
In the past 5 years, 78% of the books I've read are Fiction (80% of pages read were also Fiction). You can see more here.

### I haven't read in a while, what books do you recommend I start to get back into reading?

I get asked this a lot. Usually my answer is [Shadow of the Wind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1232.The_Shadow_of_the_Wind). 

It really just depends on what you are looking for.

### What book surprised you the most?
In 2019 it was probably _11/22/63_; I did not know much about Stephen King and only ever associated him with Horror or the Dark Tower. This was a fantastic book, its daunting in size, but just such an amazing story.

_The White Album_ by Joan Didion also surprised me, mainly because I had no idea what to expect, it being the first time I would be reading her.

_Men Without Women_ was a surprise two-fold, one because it was gifted to me as a surprise (thanks Thailandia Crew!). Second, because Murakami wasn't known to me as the kind of writer he showed himself to be in that book.

### Which Authors have you read the most books/works of?

Not limiting to these past 5 years it's:

Neil Gaiman, JK Rowling, and Brandon Sanderson top the list

Then its: Joan Didion, Shakespeare, Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf, Malcolm Gladwell, Haruki Murakami, F Scott Fitzgerald, Stephen King, Ernest Hemingway, Kazuo Ishiguro, Kurt Vonnegut

### Other things you've learned about your reading habits?

![author make up](/images/reading-post/authors-2015-2019.png)
![publication](/images/reading-post/published-2015-2019.png)

- I read 341 books, of them there were 212 unique authors (62%)
- ~39% of the books I read are written by female authors
- ~50% of the books I read are between 250-500 pages, ~19% are above 500 pages
- ~53% of the books I read are publihsed in the 2000s, ~36% published in the 1900s
- On average the books I read have ~360 pages, and I tend to read 67 pages per day, so ~ 5.5 days per book

### What other analysis will you be doing?

I want to look more into the genres I read and how I lean: biographies/memoirs, mystery/crime, sci-fi/fantasy, psychology/sociology, general business, etc... 

Another thing is an understanding of the types of authors I am reading, I want to make sure I'm reading from a diverse crowd.

Essentially, one of my goals with analyzing what I read is to continuously be a diverse reader.

### What are you going to read next?

I haven't planned things out perfectly. Currently I'm reading [Bird by Bird](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12543.Bird_by_Bird) by Anne Lamott. So that will be my first read of 2020. After that, maybe [Vincent Van Gogh's biography](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40819475-van-gogh).

Maybe I'll finally get to [_In Search of Lost Time_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12749.Swann_s_Way)
