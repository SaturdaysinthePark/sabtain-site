My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2674816341">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I seem to find myself in a Labyrinth from time to time, and somehow find my way out. Although, the labyrinths I successively encounter through life tend to be more elaborate, less physical, more daunting, and less confident in the escape not just leading into another labyrinth wondering if I'm still trapped.<br /><br />Miles' obsession with last words, I thought that was clever... if exiting the Labyrinth means death, last words are just that much more important.. its a state of mind at the end and is very telling of the person. It made me think of what my last words might be.<br /><br />This book reminded me to read more <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13450.Gabriel_Garc_a_M_rquez" title="Gabriel García Márquez" rel="nofollow">Gabriel García Márquez</a> :)
