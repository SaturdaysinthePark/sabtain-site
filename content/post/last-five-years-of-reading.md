# Summary

I sort of segmented everything in this pseudo FAQ, based on real questions I get about books and my reading habits. It seems like a nice way to convey everything, and I hope you enjoy.


### How many books did you read this year (2019)?
82, but the amount isn't _that_ important.

### How do you read so much?
The most important thing I do is set aside an hour a day to read, just about nothing gets in my way of that time. Then there is time waiting on trains, in a train, waiting for a plane, on a plane, etc.. Then there are glorious days where I do nothing but read.

The point is. I don't read fast. I just spend a lot of time reading. I'll elaborate further:

Test yourself later, go to this site: https://howlongtoread.com/books/3032/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerers-Stone

Click on `Test Reading Speed` and then compare with my result below:

```
You read 226 words in 38.2 seconds. Your recorded speed for this passage was 355 words per minute. It will take you 4 hours and 31 minutes to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
```

My speed fluctuates, sometimes its 400 words per minute, sometimes its 350. _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_ would be 3.5 hrs to 4.5 hrs, depends on focus, coffee, whether or not I take notes, and how much notes I take - some book I'm jotting a lot down.


### Why do you read so much?
I picked up reading much more in 2014. Two books encouraged me read much more. First, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo got me turning pages like no other. Second, Alexander Hamilton's biography by Ron Chernow.

I learned that just about every major leader in our world was obsessed with reading. Since then I've taken notice that people like Barack Obama, Napoleon Bonaparte, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Teddy Roosevelt, etc... are (or were) all voracious readers.

At this point, its an irrefutable fact to myself that I would not see any successes personally or professionally if I was not actively reading like I am now.

### How do you pick your next book?
Its all a feeling and relevancy thing. I try to change up what I'm reading often, so that I'm not stuck in the same genre.

### Do you really read Harry Potter every October?
Yes! That's my tradition. Its fun and I've learned others I've met who have traditions with Jane Austen, Tolkien, etc... 

### Where and when do you read?
When I first moved to New York, I was reading in the evening, usually at The Bean on 2nd Ave.

Now, I am generally reading before work ~7:30AM to 8:30am (give or take 15 minutes) at a coffee shop called City of Saints.

### Do you read on your phone on kindle? audio book?
Primarily, I read in hardcover or paperback books. I never got into audio books, just not my cup of tea.

### Do you take notes while you read?
Initially, I did not. I sort of scribbled in the book I was reading: underlinining, circling, etc...

Two years ago I started to write notes in a journal.

This year I've begun to write reviews (on GoodReads and published on this site)
