# Summary

I sort of segmented everything in this pseudo FAQ, based on real questions I get about books and my reading habits. It seems like a nice way to convey everything, and I hope you enjoy.

A lot of the stats/figures I reference are actually part of a spreadsheet I use to track my reading habits, check it out [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nwb3f6ellfckRrbwsnnP2fp8JWe8oTKoVJ2UXICE_R8/edit?usp=sharing).


### How many books did you read this year (2019)?
82, but the amount isn't _that_ important.

### How do you read so much?
The most important thing I do is set aside an hour a day to read, just about nothing gets in my way of that time. Then there is time waiting on trains, in a train, waiting for a plane, on a plane, etc.. Then there are glorious days where I do nothing but read.

The point is. I don't read fast. I just spend a lot of time reading. I'll elaborate further:

Test yourself later, go to this site: https://howlongtoread.com/books/3032/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerers-Stone

Click on `Test Reading Speed` and then compare with my result below:

```
You read 226 words in 38.2 seconds. Your recorded speed for this passage was 355 words per minute. It will take you 4 hours and 31 minutes to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
```

My speed fluctuates, sometimes its 400 words per minute, sometimes its 350. _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_ would be 3.5 hrs to 4.5 hrs, depends on focus, coffee, whether or not I take notes, and how much notes I take - some book I'm jotting a lot down.


### Why do you read so much?
I picked up reading much more in 2014. Two books encouraged me read much more. First, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo got me turning pages like no other. Second, Alexander Hamilton's biography by Ron Chernow.

I learned that just about every major leader in our world was obsessed with reading. Since then I've taken notice that people like Barack Obama, Napoleon Bonaparte, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Teddy Roosevelt, etc... are (or were) all voracious readers.

At this point, its an irrefutable fact to myself that I would not see any successes personally or professionally if I was not actively reading like I am now.

### How do you pick your next book?
Its all a feeling and relevancy thing. I try to change up what I'm reading often, so that I'm not stuck in the same genre.

### Do you really read Harry Potter every October?
Yes! That's my tradition. Its fun and I've learned others I've met who have traditions with Jane Austen, Tolkien, etc... 

### Where and when do you read?
When I first moved to New York, I was reading in the evening, usually at The Bean on 2nd Ave.

Now, I am generally reading before work ~7:30AM to 8:30am (give or take 15 minutes) at a coffee shop called City of Saints.

### Do you read on your phone on kindle? audio book?
Primarily, I read in hardcover or paperback books. I never got into audio books, just not my cup of tea.

### Do you take notes while you read?
Initially, I did not. I sort of scribbled in the book I was reading: underlinining, circling, etc...

Two years ago I started to write notes in a journal.

This year I've begun to write reviews (on GoodReads and published on this site)

### Do you mostly read fiction or non-fiction?
In the past 5 years, 78% of the books I've read are Fiction (80% of pages read were also Fiction). Below you can see my breakdown:

### I haven't read in a while, what books do you recommend I start to get back into reading?

I get asked this a lot. Usually my answer is Shadow of the Wind. 

It really just depends on what you are looking for.

### Which books impacted you the most?

Why We Sleep

The Courage to be Disliked

### What book surprised you the most?
In 2019 it was probably _11/22/63_; I did not know much about Stephen King and only ever associated him with Horror or the Dark Tower. This was a fantastic book, its daunting in size, but just such an amazing story.

_The White Album_ by Joan Didion also surprised me, mainly because I had no idea what to expect.

_Men Without Women_ was a surprise two-fold, one because it was gifted as a surprise. Second, because Murakami wasn't known to me as the kind of writer he showed himself to be in that book.

### Who are some of your favorite authors these past 5 years?

Like all 'favorites' this is hard to pinpoint, but I'll name a few that I find myself loving:

- Joan Didion (The White Album, The Year of Magical Thinking)
- Fyodor Dostoyevsky (Crime and Punishment, Notes from Underground)
- Neil Gaiman (Neverwhere, Coraline, American Gods)
- Jane Austen (Pride and Prejudice)
- Agatha Christie (And Then There Were None, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd)

### Which Authors have you read the most books/works of?

Not limiting to these past 5 years its:
Neil Gaiman, JK Rowling, and Brandon Sanderson top the list

Then its: Joan Didion, Shakespeare, Virginia Woolf, Gladwell, Murakami, Fitzgerald, Stephen King, Hemingway, Kazuo Ishiguro, Kurt Vonnegut

### Other things you've learned about your reading habits?
In the past 5 years:

- ~39% of the books I read are written by female authors
- ~50% of the books I read are between 250-500 pages, ~19% are above 500 pages
- ~53% of the books I read are publihsed in the 2000s, ~36% published in the 1900s
- On average the books I read have ~360 pages, and I tend to read 67 pages per day, so ~ 5.5 days per book
- I read 341 books, of them there were 212 unique authors (62%)

### What other analysis will you be doing?

More interest into genres I read: biographies/memoirs, mystery/crime, sci-fi/fantasy, psychology/sociology, general business, etc... I want to know where I lean.

Another thing is an understanding of the types of authors I am reading, I want to make sure I'm reading from a diverse crowd.

### What are you going to read next?

I haven't planned things out perfectly, as mentioned before. Currently I'm reading [Bird by Bird](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12543.Bird_by_Bird) by Anne Lamott. So that will be my first read of 2020.
