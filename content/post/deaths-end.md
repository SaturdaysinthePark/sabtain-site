My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2763986689">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
In the finale of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872.The_Three_Body_Problem__Remembrance_of_Earth_s_Past__1_" title="The Three-Body Problem (Remembrance of Earth’s Past #1) by Liu Cixin" rel="nofollow">The Three-Body Problem</a> series, the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817.The_Dark_Forest__Remembrance_of_Earth_s_Past___2_" title="The Dark Forest (Remembrance of Earth’s Past, #2) by Liu Cixin" rel="nofollow">The Dark Forest</a> concept and its effect still carries over. We go from Earth communicating with an alien planet to Earth defending and advancing itself in response to that communication and now to new universes and unknown concepts in space and time.<br /><br />Concepts you never even thought about are surfaced here, like the concept of manipulating lightspeed, or crazier just in general of the concept of using physics as a weapon. It goes back to the concept in the first book about how the limits and concepts we have discovered may only be just be limited because a separate entity is limiting us without our explicit knowledge.<br /><br />All in all, I loved this series from the beginning. It was truly something very different to anything I have read before. It may be slightly weak when it comes to characters, but it is very strong in making you think about the future of science. We all look at sci fi as preposterous, but go back a century and look today, and you'll realize not much of the sci fi back then was preposterous. I expect the concepts surfaced here will inspire readers to champion science fiction into reality, just as those before <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5780686.Liu_Cixin" title="Liu Cixin" rel="nofollow">Liu Cixin</a> have.
