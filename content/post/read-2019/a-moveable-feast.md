My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2792878645">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I love this book, I love Hemingway and his recounting of his life in Paris, you truly feel what it meant to be in his shoes at that time there. I love his relationships, and his adventures with Fitzgerald, who is totally bananas. Hemingway and his wife have a splendid love, and their life in Paris sort of has a rosy tint, but still manages to make it clear that he's surviving on pennies.<br /><br />I read this while on a business trip in Paris, and even strolled over to Shakespeare and Company to complete the pilgrimage. I walked to the Louvre and went to the statue gardens to see just exactly what Fitzgerald and Hemingway decided to after Fitzgerald's scare. <br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed reading this, and highly recommend fans of Hemingway, classic literature, or Paris to pick this up. <br /><br /><blockquote>"I wish I had died before I loved anybody but her"</blockquote><br /><br />I love that quote, it encapsulates the feeling of remembering a prior love before having moved on to new love, when truly the old (often the first) one was so sweet.<br /><br />Some new words I learned that I liked:<br /><br />*inaccrochable*: A picture that cannot be hung or sold because it cannot be hung.<br />*poivrottes*: Female drunkards
