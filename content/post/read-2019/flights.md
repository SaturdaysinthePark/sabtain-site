My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3008419876">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
A book about how things in motion are the most beautiful. I feel that way sometimes. This is a collection of writings, essays, stories, and travel musings. However, I would say there is something beautiful about something that can sit still in the noise. This book was full of motion, but maybe too much motion. Every few pages I felt thrown off. I want to love this more, but the sporadicness of this, and the lack of tone, really brought this down for me. <br /><br />
