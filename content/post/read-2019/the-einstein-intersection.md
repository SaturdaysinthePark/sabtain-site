My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2745329280">2 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I read this book in one sitting and don't have much to say about it. One of those random pick ups. It's always important to read anything you find interesting enough....but this book seemed formless and odd to me, I bet there is something in its references and oddities that is important for the reader who has prior knowledge coming into this.
