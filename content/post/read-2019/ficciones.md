My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2726836873">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Jorge Luis Borges' collection of short fiction stories is a serial amount of philosophical, societal, and human perspectives you and I will never have thought about until the words on these pages were crossed by our eyes. This will make you question how you look at Time, Perception, Religion, Information, Luck, Reality, etc... it will bend the world and turn it around and then serve it to you in a plate upside down.<br /><br />It's a pleasure to read, but I wouldn't say it is meant for pleasure. You read these stories, and you continue to read them, because it challenges your way of thinking.<br /><br />I highly recommend, especially if you're a fan of things like Black Mirror or Twilight Zone, where short anthological pieces are strung together by a loose theme and make you contemplate a perspective you may not be familiar with.
