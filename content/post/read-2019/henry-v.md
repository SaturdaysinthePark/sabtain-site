My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3036969732">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Here's a war story up there with the like of many others, where Henry V battles France against all odds. Henry IV part 1 and 2 were about Prince Hal's ascension and removal of his rebellious persona, Henry v is much more about Prince Hal's ability to lead as a king, finding royal purpose and being a general.<br /><br />Everything from how the Dauphin (French prince) insults Henry V with a gift of tennis balls, implying that he should go play besides himself, to the Battle of Agincourt and Henry's speech to rally the outnumbered troops - make this play witty and gruesome. Its funny to think that just a play ago, Henry V was Prince Hal, a rebellious little rascal prince, and now he is equating himself to Saint George in battle:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />KING HENRY<br />Follow your spirit, and upon this charge<br />Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Then there is the scene before the Battle of Agincourt, where Henry V disguises himself as a commoner to understand his troops morale and feelings. The troops don't agree with the King, they think the war is pointless, etc.... So, usually when a King does that, he finds out he is doing something wrong or foolish, or being arrogant. But no! King Henry V? He's literally doing God's work, he doesn't feel responsible for their lives, he needs to rally his troops, so he doubles down and delivers one of the most famous speeches ever:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />KING HENRY<br />We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;<br />For he to-day that sheds his blood with me<br />Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,<br />This day shall gentle his condition;<br />And gentlemen in England now a-bed<br />Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,<br />And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks<br />That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Sadly Falstaff is not a part of this play, he gets silently killed off. <br /><br />Shakespeare acknowledges at the end that this is a brief glimpse into Henry V's reign, really just about his warfare, and we come to the end here. <br /><br />Four plays, about kings - who are really just humans with a fancy crown on their heads - trying to do some conquering, and none of them doing anything worthwhile for their people. It's about holding on to power in the face of rebellion, assassination, and more. It's about how it's not about the people or the commoners, who are just ammo to the Kings.
