My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2735660268">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
There are many 'beasts' in this novel, and you learn about what drives these 'beasts' into abuse, murder, and more. The whole novel takes place around a train line, and the Train itself is a character of its own, and the way Zola describes the Train is better than most authors ability to describe their human characters.<br /><br /><blockquote> "...the train was passing in all its stormy violence, as if it might sweep away everything that lay in its path."</blockquote><br /><br />In the novel, Zola analyzes different kind of 'beasts', for example one character, Roubard, kills based on calculation and another, Jacques, kills based on desire.<br /><br /><blockquote>"Oh! To plunge a knife in like that, to satisfy that distant longing..."</blockquote><br /><br />Zola also does a terrific job of mocking English detective novels that seemingly resolve quite perfectly. <br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book, and if you enjoy a fun thrilling novel that spends time analyzing these dark themes with fantastic detail and description, pick this up!<br /><br />Read this if you enjoyed <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment" title="Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky" rel="nofollow">Crime and Punishment</a>!
