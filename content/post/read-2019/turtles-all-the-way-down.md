My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2744376411">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I thought this was good, but not as good as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99561.Looking_for_Alaska" title="Looking for Alaska by John Green" rel="nofollow">Looking for Alaska</a>. I know that the topic is different, and I think this is a great accessible book for those who want to read about a character with a disorder they can relate to. I loved Aza, but I think the overall plot was meh. That doesn't mean its not a decent read.<br /><br />Green is a great writer, as in, he strings together words that make you ponder deep existential thoughts. You can write a book of John Green quotes and it can read like a collection of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15321.Confucius" title="Confucius" rel="nofollow">Confucius</a> - which isn't a bad thing, I love that about John green.<br /><br />Here's one of those quotes:<br /><blockquote><br />“You're both the fire and the water that extinguishes it. You're the narrator, the protagonist, and the sidekick. You're the storyteller and the story told. You are somebody's something, but you are also your you.”<br /></blockquote><br /><br />and another:<br /><blockquote><br />“Your now is not your forever.” <br /></blockquote><br /><br />A word I learned that I loved in this book:<br /><br /><b>Cacophony</b>: A harsh discordant mixture of sounds.<br />
