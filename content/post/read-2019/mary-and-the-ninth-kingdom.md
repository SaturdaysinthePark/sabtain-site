My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2889090341">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
All aboard the train to the Ninth Kingdom, or the kingdom of frozen will. This short story felt like being aboard a train to uncertain doom. Plath's detail and symbolism is astonishing, in a short amount of time you get this eerie and uneasy feeling that the uncontrollable motion will not stop.<br /><br />You're probably going to read this if you've already read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6514.The_Bell_Jar" title="The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath" rel="nofollow">The Bell Jar</a>, its short enough to read in a single sitting while you contemplate your life choices and mortality.
