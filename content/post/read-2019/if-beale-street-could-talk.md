After reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/464260.The_Fire_Next_Time" title="The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin" rel="nofollow">The Fire Next Time</a>, I just knew I had to read more <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10427.James_Baldwin" title="James Baldwin" rel="nofollow">James Baldwin</a>. I decided to start here because the title looked familiar to me.<br /><br />I've read books about the incarceration of Black Americans, and all the injustices surrounding our country's treatment of Black Americans. I have friends who experience the tragedies of this, and I have seen the news and the stories etc... What <i>If Beale Street Could Talk</i> showed me that none of those were able to was its heartbreak and disruption to a family. It's a story about love, family, injustice, and anger. There's no happy ending, just the settling in of realities of the situation our country was in during the 60s/70s, and after reading this in 2019, how it sadly is still a relevant issue.<br /><br /><i>“Neither love nor terror makes one blind: indifference makes one blind.”</i>
