My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2749917801">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
The Sci Fi books we read 100 years ago shaped our world today and the approaching century. The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872.The_Three_Body_Problem__Remembrance_of_Earth_s_Past__1_" title="The Three-Body Problem (Remembrance of Earth’s Past #1) by Liu Cixin" rel="nofollow">The Three-Body Problem</a> will do the same for the next 500-1000 years. <br /><br />The beginning of a trilogy of sci-fi books that explore first contact, space travel, lightspeed and all the mental, political, ethical and scientific problems involved in a very realistic point of view. This isn't star trek or star wars, this isn't 'cool' fantasy sci-fi... but its mind blowing to those of us who were in awe during Physics class and loved the movie Contact growing up. Its grown up Sci fi. <br /><br />Read this if you ever thought about how the way you perceive Physics and the Universe may just be a consequence of an <i>other</i> being, or if you ever thought about the consequences to first contact, and other things such as that.<br /><br />A word I learned that I loved:<br /><br /><b>Equanimity</b>: mental calmness, composure, and evenness of temper, especially in a difficult situation.
