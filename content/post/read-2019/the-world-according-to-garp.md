My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2866532788">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
You'll laugh and be so amused as you read this book, which holds no punches in its writing and frankness, and has layers of societal and individual commentary for days. <br /><br />Jenny Fields who in a sense rejects the idea of marriage, beds a dying soldier, becomes pregnant with Garp, and then raises him without a husband. I loved the character of Jenny, she takes the feminist role to an extreme, which I believe Irving assigns to her, to draw out a larger point about how far can movements in Feminism go before they turn to ridiculousness - not that there is anything wrong with the movement. I think about the same thing with other movements.<br /><br />Jenny goes on to become a well-known writer and feminist hero. Garp, on the other hand, struggles with his writing, with romance/marriage (a thing Jenny didn't anticipate), eventually gets published but overall is a pretty funny and dismal example of a son in the context of his strong feminist mother Jenny. <br /><br />In general, this novel is complex, full of irony, and fun to read. I think I'll have to come back to it to truly value it.<br /><br />Some quotes I loved:<br /><br /><blockquote>"...wherever the TV glowed, there sits someone who isn't reading"</blockquote><br /><br />The opening line of Jenny's famous novel:<br /><blockquote>"In this dirty-minded world, she thought, you are either somebody's wife or somebody's whore â€“ or fast on your way to becoming one or the other. If you don't fit either category, then everyone tries to make you think there is something wrong with you."</blockquote><br /><br />Some words I've learned:<br /><b>Prophylatic</b>: Medicine or course of action to prevent disease<br /><b>Morass</b>:Complicated or confused situation<br /><b>Caustic</b>: Sarcaastic in a scathing and bitter way
