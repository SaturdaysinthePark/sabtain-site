My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2953765421">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
If you approach this book with the expectations of answers, then this is the <b>wrong book to read</b>. The biggest takeaway from this book is that there is a framework to help reassess the way you manage your finances, should you not already be in this framework.<br /><br />Main takeaway is: Balance your finances like 'Assets' and 'Liabilities'<br />My biggest personal distinction was that: I pay rent in NYC, that's a 'liability'. If I buy a place, that is now an 'Asset'. Specifically: The thousands I pay per month in rent, essentially goes to the garbage, if I shift that to ownership of an asset, like a Condo/Co-Op, then I am now <i>investing</i> into an asset that I own.<br /><br />There are other things that are 'Liabilities' in our lives, we can limit them or eliminate them. I unconsciously did this when I bought a used car, rather than leased a new one like my brother. My brother spent $10k+ on a new lease, that lasted two years, but then was left with no car. I paid $10K on a used car and kept that for 8 years (I donated it, but could have sold it for a small sum).<br /><br />Another takeaway was on how we assess 'luxuries': no need for that fancy Mercedes today, if it means I can save and use that savings to invest in growing my savings.<br /><br />I definitely recommend reading this, but don't expect clear concrete ways to become Rich, rather expect some advice to follow and research, and some framework for self-management.<br />
