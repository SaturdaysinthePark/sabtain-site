This isn't just an instructional book on writing, it is a bit more than that. There's the element of writing, but then the element of realistic expectations to building a skill. <br /><br /><blockquote> "Good writing is about telling the truth." </blockquote><br /><br />Quite often I have to write for work, emails, blog posts, chat messages - although not always the writing Anne may be talking about.. I think her advice can apply. In fact, it feels like all of my friends expect me to write a book, I wouldn't even know where to begin, sometimes I don't even know where to begin with a blog post for work. <br /><br />I think the pep talk aspect of this book and the little exercises that are suggested are quite obvious, but also something I would never have thought of employing in my own every day until reading this. Short writing assignments will become something I start to do; in fact, these book reviews are exactly that. However, after the last 80ish reviews I have done, maybe I structure my assignment a bit more. Homework for a book review in the future...She also comments that writer's block is just "looking at the problem from the wrong angle."<br /><br /><blockquote> "...get over perfectionism."</blockquote><br /><br />Amen to that. I sometimes struggle with this, but her suggestion to write your first draft and understand that <i>no one</i> has to see it is great, I tend to tell myself that already, but I think this helped me reflect to commit to that mentality.<br /><br />There's more to this book, more about characters, plot, dialogue, etc.. and she even talks about how she carried index cards around to write notes on, which is a habit I know Joan Didion employs in her day to day life. <br /><br />A lot more to talk about when it comes to this book, especially if you are a writer. I think I feel more confident in my ability to write after this, and that there are ways to improve that confidence even further, and my skill much more. I think many of us at some point have to write, whether its an email or a novel, I think it helps to read and find ways to improve your ability.<br /><br />Some words I learned reading this book:<br /><b>Kvetch</b>: Complain<br /><b>Priggish</b>: Self-righteously moralistic and superior
