My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2991210746">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
No book has ever made me feel so alone and isolated.<br /><br />Every chapter, every beat of the mallet, adds another layer of isolation, loneliness, and inability to escape that settles into your bones. I could barely put the book down, and if i did for an extended period of time, it would creep up to my brain. It starts slowly, but once its beating, it's hard to stop. <br /><br />You're only really reading because you know if you stop reading it: you will never be able to let go of the feeling of isolation and loneliness. It'll be with you indefinitely. Frankly, even after you finish, you won't be the same. Everything in my life that I didn't notice in terms of what isolates me from others became much more pronounced.<br /><br />This isn't as much of a gruesome horror, or a bloody horror, as much as it is a masterpiece in psychologically altering your brain to think about those sort of things you can not escape. <br /><br />Will I ever escape my past, achieve my goals, live the life I plan and yearn for? It made me scared to my stomach and anxious to my bones that I was Jack in some respects..and that I would never escape this isolation.<br /><br />That being said, you have to read this, whoever you are. I was amazed by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10644930.11_22_63" title="11/22/63 by Stephen King" rel="nofollow">11/22/63</a> and took another shot at <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King" title="Stephen King" rel="nofollow">Stephen King</a> - this was one terrific book.
