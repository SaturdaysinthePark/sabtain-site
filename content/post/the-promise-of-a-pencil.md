My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2760976655">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I think Adam Braun is terrific, and inspirational I thought throughout the book he had great advice to give from his first hand experiences. He reminded me that I can pursue and achieve great things if I really put my mind to it. These reminders are always important, and I ca'n't thank my friend enough for sending me this book to read.<br /><br /><blockquote><br />"There actually will be times in life when you should choose money over experience...but make that choice when the margin is much bigger...millions of dollars, not thousands."<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I love how small things make a big difference in his mind, and how right he can be. Like 'nonprofit' has the prefix 'non', which makes it sound negative. So instead calling it 'social impact or 'for-purpose' there was a shift in its messaging, invest into a sense of purpose.<br /><br />I could totally relate to the weakness of asking for money or funding. I hate asking people for things, and I thought it was so interesting that he recognizes and reveals that to the board, in order to get help from them in regards to improving that weakness.<br /><br />Overall, a great read, I think everyone working to achieve their dreams will find value in Braun's recollection of his path to launching Pencils of Promise.
