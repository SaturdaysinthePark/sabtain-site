My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2669118632">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This book opens up very strong, and the characters and their mysterious origins and powers are quite interesting. The central plot is about 12 adopted siblings with special unique powers, working together to go back to their home, the mysterious 'Library'. Along the way you learn about their powers and how they came to be, as well as their adopted 'Father'.<br /><br />Sadly, apart from that, this book seemed like a dead end. The characters and concepts had potential, but the overall excitement and plot seemed quite dull as you progressed. Read if you like super power themed science fiction fantasy....
