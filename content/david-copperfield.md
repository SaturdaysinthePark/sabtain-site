My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2678982284">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This is one of the few novels that I felt <b>complete</b> at its finish. Yes, parts of it are slow, but if you pay attention, and think deeply about the characters and how everything plays out chapter by chapter.... you will get entranced in the beautiful Dickensian language and the plots eventually embodying the protagonist, David Copperfield.<br /><br />The novel is about David Copperfield, and his coming-of-age... It features everything, from childhood abuse and trauma, schooling, loss, friendship, family, love, marriage, business, villains etc... Alogn the way, it helped me realize that things CAN be alright, and with time, patience and perseverance, I could overcome many obstacles.<br /><br />Read this if you love the English language, enjoy reading a novel with a merry number of colorful characters, and interested in journeying in Dickens' shoes.<br /><br />Definitely recommended, and I will have to catch up on some other Dickens' novels, apart from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1953.A_Tale_of_Two_Cities" title="A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens" rel="nofollow">A Tale of Two Cities</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2623.Great_Expectations" title="Great Expectations by Charles Dickens" rel="nofollow">Great Expectations</a> which I love.
