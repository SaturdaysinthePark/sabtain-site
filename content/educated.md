My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2660643213">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This was a tough book to read because of the frustration at the circumstances Tara was born into and the inability for many around her to provide proper support to her, but at the same time it was hard to put down. There are still - and may always be - families diseased with issues that stem from inflicted personality, poor history, and sheltered environments, and it seeps into the parents' children and affects them in so many various harmful ways. Escape seems impossible, yet Tara proves otherwise. Her story is rare, so many other children are forgotten and dragged down because of their families.<br /><br />Tara's story reminded me that I have a lot to be thankful for; even the privilege to read her story. I hope many more read this and that some of those readers get a similar reminder and appreciation for whatever generous circumstances in life they have.<br />
