### Who am I and what is this page?

My name is Sabtain Khan, and this is my website. 

My website is really just a place for me to throw up blog posts about books I've read, and other thoughts on reading, that I want to store and share with friends.

Eventually I want to update this further, so I will explore:

- Adding a portfolio or posts about my photography
- Providing a place for my art and design work
- Creating a shop to sell my work

More to come in 2020!


Thank you for visiting, and feel free to email me at [sabtain.a.khan@gmail.com](mailto:sabtain.a.khan@gmail.com) about anything above.

### How I built this site:

I built this website by forking off of an existing HUGO template named [Hyde-y](https://github.com/enten/hyde-y), which itself is a fork of [Hyde-x](https://github.com/zyro/hyde-x) which is a redo of a Jekyll theme called [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). You can find my fork [here](https://github.com/SaturdaysinthePark/hyde-y). I manage this website on Github and deploy using netlify; its neat, and I learned a bit. For now I'll be maintaining and adding some minimal improvements to this site.
